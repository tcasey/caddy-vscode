## Hack Your Styles Even More
Some things in VS code can't be controlled by settings, but you can install [this plugin](https://github.com/be5invis/vscode-custom-css), then make a file on your computer that will hold your custom CSS, I like to make one in my root called `~/.vscodestyles.css` and then put this everything in [custom-styles.css](./custom-styles.css) into your file.

Once done, open your command palette and select enable **custom CSS and JS**

Finally reload your editor and the Custom CSS should be taking.

## Don't Like It?
Make your own theme. I consolidated some of the things I've learned in making this theme and posted about it [here](https://www.tcasey.me/vs-code-theme).

p.s. This theme is inspired by the Cobalt2 Theme. The only real differences are some variations with `tokenColors` AKA syntax highlighting.
